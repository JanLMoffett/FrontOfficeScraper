# FrontOfficeScraper

### Python code to gather names and titles from MLB front office directories online.
 
If you're looking for a job in a Major League Baseball front office like I am, you may want to learn about the people currently working for teams and what their jobs entail.  A good way to start is to compile a list of names and titles from each organization, most of which are available on official MLB team pages.  

Work in Progress!!!

[FrontOffice2.py](../master/FrontOffice2.py) - _Iterates through front office directory url's and outputs a csv file containing position titles, names from Baseball Operations tables._

This code imports [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

[FrontOfficeRolodex1.csv](../master/FrontOfficeRolodex1.csv) - _Output of FrontOffice2.py._

[CsvStuff.py](../master/CsvStuff.py) - _Module of functions to open and append to csv files._
